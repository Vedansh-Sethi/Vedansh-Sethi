# Hi, I am Vedansh Sethi 👋

### Aspiring Neuro-AI developer 🧠 | C++ learner 💻 | Curious about brain and it's working 🧬

I'm a college student passionate about combining **low level programming** with **neuroscience** to build intelligent, brain-insipired systems. currently mastering C++ (core + intermediate) while working on small projects to build a good undertstanding of use case of things I am learning.

### Tech stack 🛠️ :
- Languages: learning C++, and will move to python next.
- Tools: Git, VS Code, HackerRank
- Learning: Memory management

### My goals 🚀:
- Build my own brain-like AI from scratch.
- Master C++ → Python → Machine Learning → AI
- Understand how the brian works and simulate it in machines.
