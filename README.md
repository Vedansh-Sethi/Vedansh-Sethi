# 👋 Hi, I'm Vedansh Sethi

### 🧠 Aspiring Neuro-AI Developer | 💻 C++ Learner | 🧬 Curious About How the Brain Works

I'm a college student passionate about combining **low-level programming** with **neuroscience** to build intelligent, brain-inspired systems. Currently mastering C++.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Languages:** Learning `C++`, moving to `Python` next

### 🚀 My Goals:
- Build my own brain-like AI from scratch
- Master the path: `C++ → Python → Machine Learning → AI`
- Understand how the brain works and simulate it in code

📌 **Pinned Repos Coming Soon:**  
I’ll be uploading learning projects, challenge solutions, and eventually original experiments at the intersection of neuro and code.
